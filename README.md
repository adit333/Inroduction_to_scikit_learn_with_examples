# Using_scikit-learn_with_Examples
Here, a brief introduction is provided for the syntax and inner mechanisms of scikit-learn and the algorithms it implements. 
The topics covered and given examples for are:
1) Supervised Learning
  - kNN Classification & Regression
  - Linear Models
      - Least Squares
      - Lasso
      - Ridge Regression
      - Logistic Regression
      - SVM (Kernel Trick also)
   - Ensemble Decision Tress
      - Random Forests
      - Gradient Boosting
   - Neural Networks
   
2) Unsupervised Learning
  - PCA
  - NMF
  - k-Means Clustering
  - DBSCAN
  
3) Feature Engineering
  - One-Hot-Encoding
  - Binning/Discretization
  - Interactions & Polynomial Features

4) Model Evaluation
  - Cross Validation
     - Leave-one-our Cross Validation
     - Shuffle-split Cross Validation
     - Cross Validation with Groups
     - Stratified k-Fold Cross Validation
   - GridSeacrhCV
   
 5) Building Pipelines
